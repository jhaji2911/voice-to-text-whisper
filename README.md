## phi-3 instruct for ollama mac
-- This code is copy of [Andy Peatling](https://github.com/apeatling) from his awesome work : [ollama-voice-mac](https://github.com/apeatling/ollama-voice-mac) (Please give him a ⭐️) and I'm just trying to adapt it for phi-3 instruct, which can run on low powered macs.
-- This is a very basic adaptation and may not work as expected, please use at your own risk.
-- I am trying to make this code interoperable for js libraries which can just get the output without any other setup or configuration.
